# AGNOSTER THEME

Giving credit, this is just the [agnoster theme](https://github.com/agnoster/agnoster-zsh-theme) with 2 tweaks

- changed red-green git states to red-blue for friendliness to red-green colorblind users (me)
- more compatible branch character. I was not able to get the fonts updated to display the branch icon displayed in the repo

Also, in my `~/.zshrc` I have the following line because `DEFAULT_USER` is not set on my machine; matebook pro running elementary os

```
# set to avoid showing user on normal host
DEFAULT_USER=andrew
```
